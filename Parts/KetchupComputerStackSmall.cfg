	description = This small computer was designed as an advanced replacement for the STEADLER Engineering Corps' RC-001S Remote Guidance Unit. Using a blazing fast DCPU-16 processor with a clock speed of 100KHz and 128KB of all the memory anyone would ever need, its capabilities are limited only by the imagination. Unfortunately no one can figure out how to actually make it do anything.
